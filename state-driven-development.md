The main thesis of this article is that the applicationâ€™s state (or possible states) should be the starting point for every development process. In the example given in the article, we are presented with two possible states for a sign up promotional on an e-commerce website: logged in or logged out. Before building out this component, the writer suggests that we stop and determine if this piece of UI should be one component or two. He suggests that the banner should be broken into two components because the resulting UI is completely different depending on the state of the user (despite the fact that the visual element appears on the same spot on the page in either case). By stopping to think about what possible states your application can be in as in the example above, the author argues that the cognitive load is reduced and the component becomes easier to test.  State driven views are important for all of the reasons listed above and React enables these patterns by creating a single source of truth in the state object so that we can update or render different components depending on which state our application is in at the current moment.
